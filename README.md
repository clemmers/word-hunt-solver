Word Hunt Board Solver (Game Pigeon)

Given an n x m board of letters, this solver finds all possible words that could be created using the rules of Word Hunt*

Prints the words to console from longest to shortest (minimum length three) and saves a copy of the words to output.txt

Note: you have to manually edit the board at the top of main.cpp


*Rules of Word Hunt: Start on any tile. You can move to any neighboring tile as long as it is not used earlier in the word.
